* Developer documentation
** Browser target versions
This extension mainly targets supported versions of Firefox. An overview about those can be found in the [[https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Release_Management/Calendar&redirect=no][release calendar]].

Typically ESRs are holding back what can be supported - so end of support from Mozilla side also may mean end of support from this extension to get rid of some workarounds.

** Developing on Firefox
Open a new tab and go to about:debugging (links to internal pages are not possible). Then "This Firefox" -> "Load Temporary Add-on...", navigate to add on folder, and select manifest.json.

To get a debugger for the background script click on "Inspect".

In case not all sources are displayed reload the page - missing background.js here will cause missing log entries.

[[https://developer.mozilla.org][MDN]] has decent documentation about [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions][writing browser extensions.]] The [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension][first extension]] example is useful for a quick introduction on how things work, [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Examples][the examples]] useful for going a bit more in depth.

Both [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Background_scripts][background scripts]] and [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts][content scripts]] sections should be understood for this extension - a lot of required functionality can be only implemented in one location, so messages need to be passed around to make things work.

The [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs][API support page]] is very useful to determine the minimum version of Firefox this can support, as well as checking which other browsers this could be ported to with minimal effort.

** Future development
- Integrate with [[https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons][Tree Style Tab]]
- Adding a [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Toolbar_button][toolbar button]] might offer some more options for search and URL entry
- Add Chrome support. MDN has documentation on [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Build_a_cross_browser_extension][writing cross browser extensions]]. Basic functionality is working on Chrome, things like search are harder to implement due to lacking APIs.
